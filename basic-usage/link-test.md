# link test

basic usage document


## link to sections

link to section title: [link to files](#link-to-files)

* this works with `MARKDOWN_ID_STYLE` set to `GITHUB`


WARNING: Namespace for labels in markdown are restricted to a single file. But doxygen extends markdown labels to the hole project, leading to weird situation. 

For example, this is a link, [to-basic](#basic), underling code is `[to-basic](#basic)`. There is not a section named "basic" in this document so preview this document with a markdown editor and click the link. It is expected to get an error message like "link not found" or nothing happens. But open the HTML version of this file generated by doxygen and click the link. You will jump to the "basic" section of file "use-markdown/markdown-test.md".


## link to files

### TLDR

* to `.md` files: markdown link `![]()`. 
* to code files (`.h`, `.cpp` etc.): auto-link wrapped with `inline-code`, e.g. \`path/to/file\`

### usage

There are several methods to link to files:

* auto-link: a string is converted to a link if a documented file exists at the path indicated by the string. Use `%` to avoid auto-link.

* explicit link: `\ref` command. Supported by doxygen but markdown editing programs would not process the command and the programs render it as raw text, terrible for reading.

* markdown link: `![]()` style link. Work well with markdown document target (`.md` files), but break down with code file targets, such as `.cpp` and `.h` files.

### examples

link to files under the same parent folder:

* markdown: [main.cpp](main.cpp). NOT WORK
* auto-link: `main.cpp`.
* auto-link: `lib/class.h`.
* avoid auto-link: `%main.cpp`

link to file under a neighborhood of the parent folder: 

* to markdown file:
    * markdown style: [math.md](../use-markdown/math.md)
    * doxygen style 1: `../use-markdown/math.md`. NOT WORK.
    * doxygen style 2: `use-markdown/math.md`. NOT WORK
    * explicit: \ref "use-markdown/math.md" "link title"
        * works but terrible for markdown preview

* to code file:
    * markdown style: [test-link.h](../use-markdown/test-link.h). NOT WORK
    * doxygen style 1: `test-link.h`
    * doxygen style 2: `../use-markdown/test-link.h`. NOT WORK
    * doxygen style 3: `use-markdown/test-link.h`. WORKS
    * explicit: \ref "use-markdown/test-link.h"

* link to code files under different folders but have the same name:
    * doxygen style 1: `test-link-dup.h`. NOT WORK
    * doxygen style 2: `../basic-usage/test-link-dup.h`. NOT WORK
    * doxygen style 3: 
        * `basic-usage/test-link-dup.h`
        * `use-markdown/test-link-dup.h`
    * explicit:
        * \ref basic-usage/test-link-dup.h "under basic-usage"
        * \ref use-markdown/test-link-dup.h "under markdown"
